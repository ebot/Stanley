#about
  My name is Stan, and I had a blast traveling around the Philadelphia 
  area with Kayla and Lindsey.  I am very glad that Ansley decided to 
  send me to their house.  We got to go to lots of cool places this summer!  
  These are a few of my favorite photos from our adventures.  You can see 
  all of our adventures at
